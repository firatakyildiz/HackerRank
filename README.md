# HackerRank Solutions
These are my solutions to HackerRank problems that I have currently solved(and bothered to put here).
In no way I promote cheating in these (or any other) problems.I put these here as a showcase for
my future employers, since I don't do any other kind of projects in my spare time, and putting company
owned code here would be plain wrong.For those who worked hard upon a problem but couldn't find a solution 
on their own,feel free to inspect the codes and figure out the way to solve them.

All of my work is licensed under MIT license,which basically means you can do whatever you want
(including modifying code or selling for profit) as long as you give me credit and not remove
my name and license information.

If you have any questions or comments,or should you ever want to thank me for helping you,feel free
to mail me at akyildiz.firat@gmail.com.

Have a nice day,
FIRAT AKYILDIZ
