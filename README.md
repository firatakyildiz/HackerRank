# HackerRank Solutions
These are my solutions to HackerRank problems that I have currently solved.
In no way I promote cheating in these (or any other) problems.I put these here as a showcase for
my future employers,in hope that they can have some clue about what kind of programmer I am.
For those who worked hard upon a problem but couldn't find a solution on their own,feel free to
inspect the codes and figure out the way to solve them.

All of my work is licensed under MIT license,which basically means you can do whatever you want
(including modifying code or selling for profit) as long as you give me credit and not remove
my name and license information.

If you have any questions or comments,or should you ever want to thank me for helping you,feel free
to mail me at akyildiz.firat@gmail.com.

The solutions to the problems presented here are divided into packages and classes.Each solution has
its own class and it implements IProblem interface for convenience(my convenience,not yours sorry).
There is only one main method,which is found in HackerRank class.To execute the solution of a specific
problem,just change the class name in this main method.There are only 2 lines in here,you can not miss it.
For submitting a problem,you need to copy the contents of the solve method into existing main method in the editor.
You also have to copy and paste any existing members,imports and additional methods.Since HackerRank editor calls the 
static main method,you then have to add "static" to everything.But you should have already known that if you are
submitting java solutions.

Have a nice day,
